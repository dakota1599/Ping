# Ping

Ping is a desktop app that pings Google, Yahoo, and a url/IP of the users choosing at a frequency the user chooses (1sec - 60sec).  It adds to a log of pings so users can see if their device disconnects from the internet at any time.  That log can be saved to anywhere the user chooses on their device.
